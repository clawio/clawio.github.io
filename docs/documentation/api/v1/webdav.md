ClawIO offers WebDAV support.

Access to the core APIs using WebDAV is possible due to new WebDAV APIs:

+ [StorageDAV API](documentation/api/v1/storagedav): access to resources from the [Storage API](documentation/api/v1/storage).
+ [LinkDAV API](documentation/api/v1/linkdav): access to public links from the [Link API](documentation/api/v1/link).
+ [ShareDAV API](documentation/api/v1/sharedav): access to internal shares from the [Share API](documentation/api/v1/share).
+ [FedShareDAV API](documentation/api/v1/fedsharedav): access to federated shares from the [FedShare API](documentation/api/v1/fedsharedav).

ClawIO offers support not just for accessing your resources in your home directory, but also all your links and all the shares.
This fact makes ClawIO unique.
