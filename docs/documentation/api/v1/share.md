# Introduction

The Storage API manages storages and their resources.

A resource can be: 

* `Object`: it contains binary data. Depending on the storage it can be a file, a BLOB object or anything that is not a Container.
* `Container`: it contains other resources. Depending on the storage it can be a folder, a bucket or anything that is not an Object.

A Resource URI is powerful addressing scheme to identify diferent storages.
It is usually referenced by the  `:resourceuri` placeholder.

The Resource URI can take two forms:

1. **Path format**: When referencing a resource by a path:

        storage-scheme://[[authinfo@]host]]/path[?query][#fragment]
        
    Examples:
    
        local:///docs/thesis.pdf
        swift://bucket1.tenant1.com/docs/thesis.pdf
        s3://user:password@bucket2.tenant2.example.com/docs/thesis.pdf
        
    The use of `authinfo@host` can be used in distributed storage systems. This is useful when you want talk to the closest geographically server, for example.
    
2. **ID format**: When referencing a resource by ID

        storage-scheme:opaque[?query][#fragment]
        
    The `opaque` part can be anything and it is defined by each storage.
    Some storages may use a number, other may use a hash and others maybe a path.
        
    Examples:
        
        local:docs/thesis.pdf
        eos:139128318809
        s3:de305d54-75b4-431b-adb2-eb6b9e546014
